The cult of codethulu<br>
&copy; 1982, the anonymous embedded programmer<p>
<h2>
1. Since time immemorial, new programmers have appeared in order to
bring change to the world. They wish for a chance to show the world
their skill and ability.<p>And for their sins, they get it.<p>
2. And then shall the young and inexperienced programmer proclaim loudly
to all who will listen: <br><font color="red">
"Those who came before me were ignorant and foolish."
</font>
<p>
Codethulu looks on, and says: "Well, go and see what you can do. "
<p><p>
3. The young and inexperienced programmer cries loudly to all who will
listen: <br><font color="red">
This is not a program, but a refuse bin. At every turn I find snares  to
catch the unwary, pits of refuse and stinking entrails, and the very
heart of it seems to be made of mud and sticks.</font><p>
Codethulu looks on, and says: "Well, go and see what you can do. "
<p><p>
4. The young and inexperienced programmer cries loudly to all who will
listen: <br><font color="red">
I cannot fix this. It is excrement. I can rewrite this from scratch in
less time than it will take to make the changes you seek.</font><p>
Codethulu looks on, and says: "Well, go and see what you can do. "
<p><p>
5. The young and inexperienced programmer cries loudly to all who will
listen: <br><font color="red">World, hear my cry: It would be faster and
easier to cast this away into the deep, and begin afresh. I understand
the way of the true methods; I will build an elegant tower rising up out
of the remains of this awful rubbish.</font><p>
Codethulu looks on, and says: "Well, go and see what you can do. "
<p><p>
6. Days pass, and seasons change. Projects fail, or succeed. The details
may vary, but one thing does not.<p>
On the chosen day, the young and inexperienced programmer realizes that
what he has constructed is simply a different collection of rubbish, mud
and offal than that used by the previous tower.
<p>7.
Codethulu looks on, and says: "Now you have become one of us."
